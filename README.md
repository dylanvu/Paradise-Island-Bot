# Paradise-Island-Bot
We are going to do some crazy stuff to simulate characters from paradise island
1. Taking ~10 hours worth of audio (all Paradise Island episodes), transcribing it, and separating it out to label into individual speakers
2. Taking this information and either prompt engineering or fine-tuning an LLM persona
3. Implementing RAG or some other form(s) of memory
4. Making a discord bot to interface with it, always listening, and reacting or messaging when it wants to.
5. Optional: make a frontend or way to understand how the bot is feeling
6. Scaling this up to make 10 different contestant personas
