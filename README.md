# Paradise-Island-Bot

Use Python 3.11

We are going to do some crazy stuff to simulate characters from paradise island

1. Taking ~10 hours worth of audio (all Paradise Island episodes), separating it out to label into individual speakers
2. Transcribe individual character dialogue and translating it into English
3. Taking this information and either prompt engineering or fine-tuning an LLM persona
4. Implementing RAG or some other form(s) of memory. Also working with things like an internal monologue as well.
5. Making a discord bot to interface with it, always listening to messages, and reacting or messaging when it wants to. We can include a way for it to make asides/confessionals also.
6. Optional: make a frontend or way to understand how the bot is feeling
7. Scaling this up to make 10 different contestant personas
